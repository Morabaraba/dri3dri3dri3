## Rules
# Your solution must implement the following API behaviors:
# - A "get_voters_where" endpoint that takes the following optional arguments: county, month, party affiliation, active_status, and limit (the max number of results to return). The endpoint must return a JSON-formatted output, but the schema is up to you.
# - All APIs must be RESTful (see The REST API in five minutes for some background if you need it).
